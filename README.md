### Fstr Docs

#### Overview
This is the documentation website for [fstr](https://github.com/TobinCavanaugh/fstr), my dynamic string library for C. 
It was made using mkdocs along with custom css and html. The site documents many features of `fstr`, however may be out
of date. The documentation within the `.h` file should be enough for most programmers, and the site was mainly an 
exercise in building a more accessible library documentation.

#### What I Learned:
Don't try to use mkdocs, just do this by hand. Mkdocs introduced tons of headaches with stylesheets etc, and the result 
is a bodged and finnicky website backend, it's definitely worth the time to just manually handroll CSS and html for this.
Despite the struggle, I'm very pleased at the visuals of the result. I think the website has a unique and tasteful look,
and represents what I want most programming APIs to look like. And I get that beige, tan, and dark gray are boring, but for 
readability and eyestrain it's top tier.

####  What I would Do Differently
If I were to improve the site I would make the FSTR
logo in the top left bring you back to the home page, I would make code examples collapsible, and I would make the search
styling better.
